       <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="section-two__desc">I'm a beginner web developer with a growing passion for building websites using HTML and CSS. I recently completed my first personal portfolio project, which has helped me gain hands-on experience in structuring web pages and styling them to look clean and responsive.I enjoy learning how websites work and love the creative process of turning ideas into real, working designs. Although I'm just starting out, I'm excited to keep improving my skills and learning more about web development every day. My goal is to continue practicing, take on new challenges, and eventually grow into a full-stack developer. I'm proud of what Iâ€™ve created so far and look forward to building more projects as I learn.</p>
